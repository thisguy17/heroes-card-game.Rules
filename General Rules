General Rules

Environment Cards:
When a monster card is resolved, the card is placed on that plane.
When a monster card is revealed and the plane already has a monster card, the new monster card has no effect.
When all monsters are cleared from a plane discard the associated monster card.

Bosses:
Bosses represent leaders or powerful entities of planes of existence.
There is only one of each boss. 
Bosses drop valuable rewards such as bestow effects, inflict effects on enemies, or items.
Bosses are deadly.

Decks:
Decks must have at least 30 cards (not including hero ability cards [10]; total min.: 40).
Decks cannot have more than 2 copies of any card (with the exception of basic attack and hero ability cards [10]).
Decks are shuffled at the beginning of the game, when the associated hero is recorporated, when an effect or ability says to, and when the associated hero recovers.

Items:
Items played are placed in the player's material plane or on the location they were revealed (environment/monster).
Items must be picked up by using a minor action.
A picked up item is considered "held."
Equipping an equippable item requires a major action.
Using a held item requires a major action.
Heroes may have 2 held items and 2 equipped items.

Heroes: # of levels ?? 10 or 20 (conceptualizing 20)
Heroes are associated with one of two material planes.
Heroes may return to his/her material plane to RECOVER.
Recovering requires 3 consecutive, uninterrupted rounds
- Restores HP, Cleanses effects
- Shuffles discard pile back into deck
Heroes may "Explore" on their turn.
- Draw an environment card; it takes effect immediately
When a hero loses all of its HP it dies.
When a hero dies, all of its carried items are left behind and can be picked up.
Heroes that have died RECORPORATE after a number of rounds equal to its level divided by 2 rounded up.
When a hero is recorporated, place the hero card on its home plane, restore all its hit points, cleanse all inflicted conditions, and shuffle its discard pile into its deck.

Stats Building - 100 points; +25/level; after game start each point increase costs 10% more, rounded up
Stats function like masteries (you determine your starting stats for each hero while deck building or in hero selection)
STAT POINT COSTS: SPD - 20, INT - 20, SKI - 25, STR - 3, CON - 1
-ALTERNATE:
Stats Building - 15 point base; +3/level; after game start each point increase costs more
Stats function like masteries (you determine your starting stats for each hero while deck building or in hero selection)
STAT POINT COSTS: 	SPD - 3-4-5-5-6-7-8-8-9	(9)	INT - 3-4-5-5-6-7-8-8-9	(9)	SKI - 4-5-6-7-7-8-9-10 (8)

Minimum Stats: SPD - 1, INT - 1, SKI - 1, STR - 2, CON - 10; Cost - 12; 3 Remaining

Events:
Events are environment cards that simply occur or have ongoing effects.
Events have a duration of Instant, Ongoing, or Turns.
Instant means that the event just happens. 
	- Resolves immediately
	- Effects occur and are resolved immediately
Ongoing means that the event's effects don't end until criteria (depends on the card) are met.
Turns means that the event's effects end after a number of turns.

Monster:
Monster cards are environment cards that declare that a hostile (or otherwise...) creature has appeared in a location.
A monster card has effects based on the environment in which it is placed.
When a monster card is drawn, a number between 1 and 8 is randomly determined; this is the number of creatures that will appear.
The total challenge rating of monsters that appear is equal to the average hero level.
Examples:
	- Roll is 3
	- Avg level/CR is 9
	- Location: Water Plane
	- Any combination of 3 creatures that adds up to CR9
		- Water Elemental Large CR 5
		- Sahuagin CR 3
		- Water Elemental Small CR 1

	- Roll is 1
	- Avg level/CR is 13
	- Location: Plane of Air
	- One creature, closest to challenge 13
		- Djinni CR 12

	- Roll is 8
	- Avg level/CR is 16
	- Location: Negative Plane
	- Any combination of 8 creatures that adds up to CR 16
		- Glabrezu CR 9
		- Quasit CR 2 x3
		- Dretch CR 0.25 x 4

Need to come up with pre-defined results?
example:
level 1 - 1 = 1xCR1; 2 = 2xCR0.5; 3 = 1xCR0.5+2xCR0.25; 4 = 4xCR0.25 || 2xCR0.125+1xCR0.25+1xCR0.5; 5 = etc....
Algorithms
- Generate list of all possible combinations adding up to avg lv# that has Roll# values

//declare count/fullmonlist[]/avglv/rollnum/total
for (int i; i = 0; i++)
	
	current = fullmonlist[i].cr

	total = current

	count = 1

	if(count < rollnum && total < avglv)
	
		for(int n; n=1;n++)

			next1 = fullmonlist[n]

			total = current + next1

			count++
