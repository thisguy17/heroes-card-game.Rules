turn order
	- recovery - remove action counter
	- draw 3 hero cards
	- environment
	- action/attack (any order)

Each hero in a deck starts on the base and may move to a lane as an action.
To change the lane, heroes must use their action
Each lane has a fortress which must be destroyed before the base may be attacked
The base can be defended by heroes blocking a lane or being on the base
Each hero has a role/class which determines its general stat (eg. tank - must be attacked before any other hero in lane)
