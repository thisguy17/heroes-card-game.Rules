New Terms:
- Character - any card that is a monster, hero, or ally
- Monster - neutral (to heroes) creature cards that aren't heroes
- Ally - creature cards that are aligned with a hero but aren't heroes
- Group-Up - Heroes can Group-Up with allies; While grouped up, when the hero takes move actions, the allies do the same. Otherwise, the 
	heroes and allies behave as normal.
- Encounter - When any two or more enemies are engaged in combat, that is called an encounter. Heroes, allies, and monsters can join in an
	encounter by moving. Grouped characters can also join an encounter. Leaving an encounter is called disengaging.

Game Start: (1v1)

Each player's hero card is placed on his/her stronghold.

Both players draw 5 cards (Perhaps Less or more cards)

Both players may mulligan any number of times, drawing one card less for each time (perhaps other mulligan)

------Turn 1 Begins:

The environment phase begins.
- If there are any characters in a world (that isn't a stronghold), an environment card is played on that world.
- Ongoing environment cards take effect.
- On the first turn, all characters should be in a stronghold.

The character with the highest speed(?, maybe roll a die and add speed) takes his/her turn first.
As characters (allies, monsters, etc.) are added and as the game progresses, the turn order may change.

Hero 1 Turn 1:
1. Draw Stage: The player draws cards equal to the hero's INT

2. Action Stage: The player chooses actions for the hero to take in any order

Actions Option 1: "1 Move and Actions" (easy to balance)
- There are 2 types of actions, "Moves" and "Actions"
- A hero may make a number of "Actions" equal to its speed
- A hero may make one move action at any point during its turn
- A "Move" is self explanatory; a character simply changes location on the same world or between worlds using a portal

Actions Option 2: "Actions" (complicated balancing)
- There is only one type of action
- A hero may make a number of actions equal to its speed
- There is no "Move" action, moving is a generic action

Actions Option 3: "Moves plus Actions" (easy to balance, but requires lower speeds)
- There are 2 types of actions, "Moves" and "Actions"
- A hero may make a number of "Actions" equal to its speed
- A hero may also make a number of "Moves" equal to its speed

- An action is anything that a character may do; Attack, Use Ability, Disengage, Interact with Objective, or move
see above for "number of actions" formats
	Move: the hero is moved to a new location
	Movement Examples:
	- A portal on the same world, sending the hero card to the new world associated with that portal
	- Engaging an enemy in an encounter
	- An objective on the same world
	- Group up with an ally on the same world

	Action: the hero performs an action
	Action Examples:
	- Attack an enemy; Ranged attacks can only be made while not engaged in an encounter, Melee attacks can only be made while engaged
	- Use an ability
	- Disengage; leave an encounter
	- Interact with Objective; Most items are found and must be picked up; damaging a portal focus

3. End Stage: Any effects that happen at the end of the turn happen; Any effects that last until end of turn end; etc.
